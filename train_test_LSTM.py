'''
This file contains two functions. The first one builds an LSTM RNN model, and the second one used the model to train the parameters and
tests in test set. Before the functions, some variables are defined. These variables can be changed during model evaluation process. This
file can be run directly on terminal line:

python train_test_LSTM.py

This function defines a RNN. It is an LSTM RNN for now, but if want to change to GRU, just change the
cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(rnn_size,state_is_tuple=True)
into
cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(rnn_size)

This function trains the model and tests its performance. After each iteration of the training, it prints out the number of iteration
and the loss of that iteration. When the training is done, prints out the trained parameters. After the testing, it prints out the test
loss and saves the predicted values and the ground truth values into a new .csv file so that it is each to compare the results and
evaluate the model performance. The file has two rows, with the first row being predicted values and second row being real values.
